# Learn Go with Tests

This book is for absolute beginners. Familarity with any other programming language is expected.

Following is a map of Chapter name and what topics they cover.

- **Hello, World**: Basic syntax, introduction to writing tests in Go.

- **Integers**: Documentation, example test/documentation.

- **Iteration**: For loops, benchmarks.

- **Arrays and slices**: Arrays, slices, len, test coverage.

- **Structs, methods & interfaces**: Structs, methods & interfaces and how are they used together.

- **Pointers & errors**: Pointers (copy by reference vs copy by value). Errors. `nil`.

- **Maps**: Maps (dictionaries), basic CRUD.

- **Dependency Injection**: Prerequisite to next chapter (mocking).

- **Mocking**: Test the behavior, not implementation. Don't rely on blocking resources, mimic them.

- **Concurrency**: go routines, channels, race contidions, . Make it work, make it right, make it fast.

- **Select**: Syntax sugar related to concurrency. Listen to multiple channels at once in a syntax similar to switch.

- **Reflection**: Go's internal datatypes.

- **Sync**: Supplement to concurrency. WaitGroups, Mutexes. A WaitGroup waits for a collection of goroutines to finish. A Mutex is a mutual exclusion lock. The zero value for a Mutex is an unlocked mutex.
